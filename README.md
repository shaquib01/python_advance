## Installation

To get started with any of the projects in this repository, you will need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Next, create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies. You can do this using the built-in `venv` module:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

  ```bash
  myenv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On macOS and Linux:

  ```bash
  source myenv/bin/activate
  ```

Once your virtual environment is activated, you can install project-specific dependencies using `pip`. Refer to the project's README or documentation for detailed installation instructions.

## Usage

Each project in this repository comes with its own README file that provides detailed instructions on how to use and run the code. Navigate to the specific project directory and follow the instructions provided.
