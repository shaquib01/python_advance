## 1. Python Installation on Windows

### Installation Steps:

1. **Download Python:**
   - Visit the official Python website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
   - Choose the latest version of Python and download the installer for Windows.
   - Run the downloaded installer.

2. **Installation Options:**
   - Ensure to check the "Add Python X.X to PATH" option during installation, where "X.X" is the Python version you downloaded. This makes it easier to run Python from the command line.

3. **Complete the Installation:**
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

4. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a command prompt or PowerShell and run the following command to check if Python is installed correctly:
     ```shell
     python --version
     ```
